<p>The main objective of this training is to help participants
understand the motivations, principles, and potential benefits of open
science for underrepresented communities with a focus on
Spanish-speaking research communities.</p>
<p>During this training, we will introduce the concept of open science,
along with the motivations behind it and the challenges that many
communities face when attempting to implement these principles.
Furthermore, we will elaborate on the concept of digital accessibility,
FAIR principles, and CARE principles, and discuss their impact on
people’s participation within the scientific community. Additionally, we
will showcase various open science initiatives in Latin America and the
diverse practices they employ to overcome the barriers faced by
marginalized communities in the context of science and education.</p>
<p>By the end of this training, the participants will have acquire
information that will allow them to assess the levels of accessibility
of different digital resources and virtual events. They will also be
equipped to apply best practices for fostering a more inclusive research
network for non-native English speakers.</p>

<p>Open science communities and organizations serve as platforms where
researchers and societal stakeholders converge to achieve results that
are not only technically sound but also socially significant. This is
made possible through the application of transparent, reproducible, and
verifiable methods, engaging contributors from diverse regions,
disciplines, and social contexts. However, non-native English-speaking
researchers, educators, and professionals often encounter challenges in
accessing the resources necessary to conduct their work, primarily due
to limited funding, language barriers, and geographical constraints.</p>
<p>Our objective is to shed light on how open science communities,
particularly those in regions like Latin America, actively engage in
implementing, teaching, and disseminating open practices and resources.
Drawing upon experiences from Spanish-speaking communities of practice,
we aim to collaborate with librarians to explore the specific challenges
faced by these communities when dealing with data and other resources
primarily available in English, which creates a language-based
accessibility barrier. Through these discussions, we intend to address
how open science practices can aid marginalized communities of scholars
in overcoming obstacles related to language, socioeconomic status, and
other factors, ultimately fostering a more inclusive scientific
community.</p>

</h3>
<p>English is one of the most widely spoken and understood languages
globally, for this reason it is usual to take English as the language of
scientific research that allows researchers from diverse linguistic
backgrounds to collaborate and communicate effectively.</p>
<p>However, while English serves as a valuable interchange language,
making it the dominant language of science has a negative impact on
non-English-speaking communities. It becomes a barrier to participating
fully in discussions, publishing research, or collaborating with other
groups. It also hinders the understanding and engagement of individuals
with science.</p>
<p><strong>Language is deeply intertwined with culture.</strong> By
prioritizing English, we risk embedding cultural biases into scientific
knowledge, marginalizing perspectives and practices from
non-English-speaking regions. It can also reinforce power dynamics
favoring English-speaking countries’ interests and priorities rather
than reflecting the global spectrum of challenges and needs. It can
influence decision-making, funding allocation, and the overall direction
of the scientific research agenda.</p>
<p><strong>For non-English-speaking communities, learning the language
is often reserved for people in a privileged position.</strong> Not
everyone has equal access to the resources needed to acquire a second
language. This creates an inherent bias towards individuals with better
access to educational materials, funds, and even time, further
exacerbating global inequalities in scientific participation and
representation.</p>
<p><strong>Translation is a laborious and costly process that most often
falls on the non-English speakers.</strong> One common practice in
scientific journals of different languages is the translation of
abstracts into English to enhance the visibility of the work and
accessibility for individuals who only speak English. This practice is
prevalent in most Latin American and Chinese journals, while it is
extremely infrequent in English-language journals.</p>

<h3 id="the-socio-economic-limitations">The socio-economic limitations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-socio-economic-limitations"></a>
</h3>
<p>Being a researcher in a low to middle-income country (LMIC) can
present several barriers to adopting open science practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited Access to Resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers in LMICs often lack access to necessary resources such as
high-speed internet, computing infrastructure, software, and relevant
literature. Open science heavily relies on digital platforms and
resources, and the absence of these can hinder their adoption.</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial constraints</li>
</ul>
<p>Open-access publishing, attending open science-related conferences,
or accessing open educational resources often incur costs and the
financial burden may limit the researchers’ participation in open
science practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of Funding and Support</li>
</ul>
<p>The limited availability of grants or funding for open science
initiatives may discourage researchers from actively participating or
investing time in adopting these practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of training opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>Awareness and understanding of open science practices may be lacking
or insufficient in LMICs due to limited training opportunities.
Researchers are not often familiar with the benefits or methodologies
associated with open science.</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing Pressures and Incentives</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers in LMICs frequently face pressure to conform to
traditional publishing practices rather than exploring open access
options due to concerns about career progression and recognition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Policy and Institutional Constraints</li>
</ul>
<p>Some institutions or governments in low to middle-income countries do
not have established policies or frameworks supportive of open science.
The lack of a conducive environment or encouragement from the
authorities can impede the integration of open practices.</p>
<p>Addressing these barriers requires a collective effort from the
global scientific community, encompassing financial support,
enhancements in digital infrastructure, the implementation of training
programs, the promotion of multilingualism, and the advocacy for
policies that facilitate the adoption of open science worldwide.</p>

barriers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Free access to research results: removes economic barriers,
providing equality to individuals with limited resources providing
access to high-quality scientific information.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaborative research and resource sharing: reduce costs and
overcome barriers, enabling scientists to participate in projects that
may have been individually unaffordable for them. This collaboration not
only promotes inclusion but also harnesses a broader range of knowledge
and experiences through funding, equipment, and expertise, reducing the
burden on individual researchers or institutions with limited

<p>In educational and research institutions, groups are characterized by
a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, gender identities, native
languages, socioeconomic statuses, ages, abilities, among other
attributes. Individuals can experience multiple forms of discrimination
or privilege simultaneously, based on these intersecting social
identities.</p>
<p>As a fundamental human right, digital accessibility seeks to
eliminate attitudinal, policy, and social barriers to enable all
individuals to fully engage in the digital world.</p>

</h3>
<p>Librarians play a crucial role in improving digital accessibility by
providing support, resources, and guidance. Let’s start by identifying
some key elements of digital accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Text content</strong> should be clear, concise, and
formatted in a simple manner. This helps users to easily understand and
navigate information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Images</strong> should provide alternative text or alt
text that describes the content and function of the image, making them
accessible to individuals who use screen readers or have visual
impairments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Color</strong> combinations should have sufficient
contrast to ensure readability for all users. This is especially
important for text and background colors to accommodate individuals with
visual impairments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Videos</strong> should include subtitles and audio
content. Subtitles provide a text-based version of spoken content,
benefiting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transcripts</strong> for video and audio content should
be available. Transcripts provide a written version of spoken content,
making it accessible to those who prefer to read or need an alternative
format.</p></li>
</ul>

</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Teach about digital accessibility best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Help creating accessible documents, websites, and
presentations.</p></li>
<li><p>Curate and promote accessible resources, databases, and
platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide consultations for researchers who need assistance making
their research materials and presentations accessible.</p></li>
<li><p>Make accessibility tools and software available to researchers
and guide them on how to use them.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer document conversion services to make research materials
accessible.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that library spaces, including computer labs and study
areas, are physically accessible to researchers with
disabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Create channels for researchers to provide feedback on the
accessibility issues they encounter.</p></li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>While digital accessibility focuses on making digital content
inclusive and user-friendly, data accessibility is concerned with making
data sets, databases, and research findings open and accessible to
researchers, policymakers, and the general public.</p>
<p>The FAIR principles are a set of guidelines and best practices
designed to improve reusability of data, which refers to the ability to
use existing data for different purposes beyond the original intent of
its collection.</p>
<p>The FAIR acronym stands for Findability, Accessibility,
Interoperability, and Reusability of data (or any digital object),
metadata (information about that digital object), and
infrastructure.</p>

<h3 id="data-should-be-findable">Data should be <em>Findable</em>
<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-should-be-findable"></a>
</h3>
<p>Data and associated metadata should be easily discoverable and
accessible by both humans and computers. This ensures that researchers,
scientists, and practitioners can efficiently locate the data they need
for their work.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="a-globally-unique-and-persistent-identifier-for-data-and-metadata">A globally unique and persistent identifier for data and
metadata<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-globally-unique-and-persistent-identifier-for-data-and-metadata"></a>
</h4>
<p>In order to be findable, (Meta) data should be assigned a globally
unique and persistent identifier. These identifiers remove ambiguity in
the meaning of the published data, they make it findable, allow
computers to interpret it in a meaningful way, and help the people who
reuse it to properly cite it.</p>
<p>Many data repositories will automatically generate them when you
store a datasets, but you can also use registry services that use
algorithms to guarantee the uniqueness of the generated identifiers.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://orcid.org/" class="external-link">https://orcid.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.doi.org" class="external-link">https://www.doi.org</a></li>
<li><a href="https://identifiers.org" class="external-link">https://identifiers.org</a></li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="descriptive-metadata">Descriptive metadata<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#descriptive-metadata"></a>
</h4>
<p>Metadata provide essential context about the data, describing its
content, structure, source, and other pertinent information. Extensive
and descriptive metadata makes it possible to automatize some routine
tasks which currently demand a lot of attention from researchers.</p>
<p>Examples of metadata frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/find-fair-data-tools/" class="external-link">https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/find-fair-data-tools/</a></li>

</h4>
<p>Merely having an identifier and detailed metadata is not enough. The
highest quality and most comprehensive datasets or digital resources are
essentially useless if users are unaware of their existence. The process
of ensuring discoverability of digital resources, particularly scholarly
research data, is a critical step in facilitating efficient access and
utilization of valuable information.</p>
<p>There are various methods that address this issue, such as indexing,
specializes repositories, and cross-linling refences.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Indexing:</strong> Search engines send out crawlers that
analyze web content, index it, and make it searchable. For scholarly
research data, specialized indexing approaches tailored to the academic
domain are necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Specialized Repositories and Catalogs:</strong> Uploading
data to specialized repositories or catalogs relevant to the specific
field of research enhances discoverability within the target
audience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross-Linking and References:</strong> Creating links
from related publications, datasets, or similar resources to the target
dataset or resource can significantly boost discoverability. Academic
papers that cite or reference the data also indirectly enhance its
visibility.</p></li>

<h3 id="data-should-be-accesible">Data should be <em>Accesible</em>
<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-should-be-accesible"></a>
</h3>
<p>Within the FAIR principles, making the data accessible refers to
making it easily available and retrievable to users and systems. It
implies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Clear Access Protocols:</strong> the protocol (HTTP, FTP,
SMTP…) should be free (no-cost) and open (-sourced) and thus globally
implementable to facilitate data retrieval and should ensure Metadata
are accessible, even when the data are no longer available</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Repositories:</strong> Storing data in reputable and
accessible repositories or data centers, which offer standardized access
methods (e.g., APIs, web interfaces), enhances accessibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standardized Formats:</strong> Using widely accepted and
standard data formats, such as Comma-Separated Values files, makes it
easier for both humans and machines to access and interpret the
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compliance with Legal and Ethical Standards:</strong>
Ensuring that data access complies with legal, ethical, and privacy
standards to protect sensitive information while enabling appropriate
accessibility.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-should-be-interoperable">Data should be <em>Interoperable</em>
<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-should-be-interoperable"></a>
</h3>
<p>Data should be easily integrated with other datasets, applications,
workflows of analysis and processing. For this,</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a language to represent information that has precisely defined
syntax and grammar, is shared and accessible so that others can learn
it, and can be used in multiple scenarios (e.g. RDF, JSON LD).</li>

<p>The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimize the reuse of data. To
achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they
can be replicated and/or combined in different settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Described with accurate and relevant details.</li>
<li>With a clear and easy-to-understand license for usage.</li>
<li>Linked to its complete history and origin.</li>

<p>To make their findings openly accessible to the public, researchers
have different options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green Open Access (Green Route):</li>
</ul>
<p>It involves self-archiving or depositing a version of a scholarly
article or research output in a repository or other online platform.
Typically, this is done after the work has been published in a
subscription-based journal. Authors retain the rights to their work and
can share it publicly without violating copyright restrictions. Green
open access enhances the visibility and accessibility of research
outputs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diamond Open Access (Diamond Route):</li>
</ul>
<p>Also known as “gold” open access, it involves making research outputs
freely accessible immediately upon publication, and readers can access
them without any paywalls or subscription fees. Diamond open access
journals often cover publication costs through various means, such as
institutional support, grants, or author fees.</p>

</h3>
<p>The ministers of Science, Technology, and Innovation from Argentina,
Colombia, Cuba, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela participated
in the regional launch of the UNESCO recommendation on Open Science from
Latin America and the Caribbean. They recognize knowledge as a human
right and, therefore, a common good of the people that should be at the
service of humanity’s needs. Because of this, they seek to challenge the
monopoly of modern science by taking actions that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advocate for sciences that prioritize citizenship,
sustainability, social inclusion, and the self-determination of the
people.</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage the involvement of indigenous peoples and local
communities in the processes of planning and formulating
policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a regional network, develop training tools, and
encourage collaboration and capacity building in open science.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide equitable access to quality education, scientific
knowledge, and socially relevant technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure equal access to scientific processes and decision-making
for achieving gender equality and promoting the inclusion of the LGBTQ+
community.</p></li>
<li><p>Strengthening mechanisms for academic mobility and participation
in open science, for women, young people, and ethnic groups.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="open-access">Open access<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#open-access"></a>
</h3>
<p>In Latin America and the Caribbean, there is a strong emphasis on
seeing knowledge as a communal asset, particularly through open access.
Policies promote the use of institutional repositories in universities
and National Science and Technology Organizations as primary tools to
endorse and expand open access initiatives in the region.</p>

<p>Latin America regulation of knowledge access:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Peru, Argentina, and Mexico: between 2013 and 2014, these
countries have opted for a legislative approach to regulate open access
policies, enacting specific laws or policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Brazil: guidelines supporting open access have been issued in the
form of declarations and manifestos, driven by various groups committed
to this cause. Additionally, there have been proposed laws (2007 y 2011)
related to open access, although they have not yet been
enacted.</p></li>
<li><p>Chile: recommendations for access and preservation of scientific
information and research data have been developed, as detailed in the

<h3 id="communities-of-practice-related-to-open-science">Communities of practice related to open science<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#communities-of-practice-related-to-open-science"></a>
</h3>
<p>Over the years, Latin America has seen a substantial growth in
communities of practice. These groups are self-organized and
self-sustained gatherings of individuals bound by a common interest or
passion, learning and improving collectively through regular interaction
(Etienne and Beverly Wenger-Trayne, 2015). In Latin America, many of
such communities focus specifically on bridging the gender gap in STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), on imparting skills
related to computational tools, or on educating about open science tools
and practices. While institutional approaches play a crucial role in
setting policies and frameworks, leveraging the strengths of communities
of practice may enhance the dissemination and adoption of open science
at a more personal, relatable, and community-driven level. Some of these
strengths are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bottom-Up Approach: Communities of practice are driven by
individuals who are genuinely passionate about the subject matter. This
grassroots involvement ensures a more organic and authentic
dissemination of open science principles, engaging individuals on a
personal level.</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusivity and Engagement: Communities of practice foster
inclusivity, encouraging diverse participation and engagement from
individuals of various backgrounds, experiences, and expertise levels.
The inclusion facilitates a broader understanding of open science and
encourages a wider range of people to adopt and promote these
practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer Learning and Collaboration: In these communities, members
learn from each other, share experiences, and collectively work towards
a common goal. This collaborative learning environment fosters a sense
of belonging and encourages the adoption of open practices through
shared knowledge and mutual support.</p></li>
<li><p>Tailored and Relevant Initiatives: Communities of practice have
the flexibility to tailor initiatives and activities to suit the
specific needs and contexts of their members. They can focus on topics
that are relevant and directly applicable to the community, ensuring
that the dissemination of open science is relatable and
actionable.</p></li>
<li><p>Agility and Adaptability: Communities of practice are agile and
adaptable to changing circumstances, technological advancements, and
emerging trends in the scientific community. They can quickly respond to
evolving requirements, making them more responsive and effective in
promoting open science practices in real-time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these communities are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.metadocencia.org/" class="external-link"><strong>Metadocencia</strong></a>
is an international community of researchers and educators dedicated to
equipping individuals and organizations from Spanish-speaking regions
and beyond by providing open science resources, delivering professional
development training, and supporting infrastructure design and
implementation. This community works to make the production,
communication, and application of scientific and technical knowledge
equitable globally.</p>
<p><a href="https://idatosabiertos.org/" class="external-link"><strong>Latin American Open
Data Initiative (ILDA)</strong></a> promotes inclusive development,
public and social innovation, and open knowledge through openness, the
use of public data, and the active participation of the communities
involved in Latin America.</p>
<p><a href="https://conectorial.netlify.app/" class="external-link"><strong>Conectorial</strong></a>
is a non-profit community of open access journal publishers and research
professionals dedicated to developing resources and means to foster
scientific production and promote the growth of Open Access journals in
Latin America. It provides a space where people related to the edition,
management, and promotion of scientific Open Access journals, as well as
research and publication of articles can meet to exchange knowledge.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="overall---">Overall ..<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overall---"></a>
</h3>
<p>The collaborative environment fostered by communities of practice not
only facilitates the emergence of research projects but also amplifies
their visibility and relevance. By encouraging the exchange of knowledge
and experiences among experts and passionate professionals, these
communities create a fertile ground for the incubation and execution of
innovative ideas. Moreover, by providing a space for interdisciplinary
collaboration, they allow diverse disciplines to converge and mutually
enrich one another, thus enhancing the quality and impact of research
projects. This interactive collaboration benefits not only those
directly involved but also contributes to the advancement of knowledge
and the progress of society as a whole.</p>

emphasizing the need to shift towards an evaluation centered on social
relevance rather than impact factor metrics.</p></li>
<li><p>Community-driven open science initiatives contribute to a more
organic and authentic dissemination of open science principles. They
facilitate inclusivity, peer learning, and tailored initiatives, making
open science more accessible and relatable at a community
